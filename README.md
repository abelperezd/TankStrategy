# TankStrategy
In this repository we find a real-time strategy game developed in Unity. I have based my work on [this course](https://www.udemy.com/course/unity-multiplayer/).

We have the necessary files to load the project and an executable inside the Builds folder. Also, in [this link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wU4sAJ-hAsY&list=PLB9_8zTTrVjrCGwse6iae4oY9OeJVtho_&index=7) you can find a demo video.
